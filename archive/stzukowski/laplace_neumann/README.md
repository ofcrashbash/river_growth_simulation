# Laplace - Neumann
 _20eta_: Growth in channel 2x50 of one bifurcating river. Testing Neumann boundary condition for eta in range (0, 0.1, ..., 1.9)
 _analytical-comparison_: Growth in channel 2x150 until first bifurcation occurs. Compared with analytical solutions in _../sandbox.nb_
 _freefem-comparison_: Growth in channel 2x50, dx=1.5. Results from RiverSim compared with FreeFEM in _../sandbox.nb_

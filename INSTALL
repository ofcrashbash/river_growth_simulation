# Installation and set-up

RiverSim - contains three major dependencies:

- Deal.II
- GMSH
- Boost

# Deal.II
There is three different ways:

- Download SDK fiels from official site: dealii.com
- Build project and install from repository
> git clone https://github.com/dealii/dealii.git
> mkdir dealii_build && cd dealii_build
> cmake ../dealii_build
> sudo make test install

-From Ubuntu packages:
> sudo apt install libdeal.ii-dev


# GMSH
There is two ways to install GMSH
- download sdk from official site: gmsh.info
- build from repository
> git clone https://gitlab.onelab.info/gmsh/gmsh.git
but carefully read installation instruction of gmsh. It depends on fltk, opengl and some others.
Also you have to chose build shared and GUI.

# Boost
There is a lot ways to install it too, but most convinient and easy is:
>sudo apt install libboost-all-dev
RiverSim depends only on "program options" and "test" modules, so if you know how you can only install these options


# Notes
Author is building from source to folders:
/usr/local/dealii or /usr/local/gmsh
if You want some others you can modify top level CMakeLists.txt fiels

in any problems, please contact me: oleg.kmechak@gmail.com

# Cross Platform
Currently RiverSim was only setuped on Linux machines(Ubuntu, Minux)
It is not a big deal to compile it on Windows, but author encountered problems with porting of Gmsh
